/**
 * This program:
 *      prompts for and reads the user's first name, then last name
 *                  -- each should be at most 50 characters
 *                  -- decide what is legitimate for characters for first and last name
 *      prompts for and reads in two int values from the user (range of values are those of a 4 byte int)
 *      prompts for and reads the name of an input file from the user
 *      prompts for reads the name of an output file from the user
 *      prompts the user to enter a password,
 *                          store the password,
 *                          then ask the user to re-enter the password and verify that it is correct
 *      password should be hashed using a salt and written to a file
 *      to validate, grab hash from file and compare it to hash from second user entry for password
 *      opens the output file and
 *          writes the user's name
 *          writes the result of adding the two integer values (no overflow should occur)
 *          writes the result of multiplying the two integer values (no overflow should occur),
 *          writes the contents of the input file
 *
 *      Each thing written should be clearly labeled (e.g. First name,
 *                                                    Last name,
 *                                                    First Integer,
 *                                                    Second Integer,
 *                                                    Sum,
 *                                                    Product,
 *                                                    Input File Name,
 *                                                    Input file contents)
